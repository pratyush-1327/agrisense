  "insuranceStoryTitle": "Soil Health",
  "insuranceStorySubtitle": "Soil Health: The Power of Green Manure",
  "insuranceStoryContent": "Soil health is the foundation of sustainable farming. Over time, excessive use of chemical fertilizers depletes soil nutrients, making it hard and unproductive. One effective way to restore soil fertility is through green manure—planting leguminous crops like clover, cowpea, or dhaincha before the main crop season.\nTo use green manure, plant legumes in the off-season and allow them to grow for 6–8 weeks before plowing them back into the soil. Over time, this practice leads to healthier, more fertile farmland, reducing dependency on costly fertilizers and improving crop yields naturally.",
  "fertilizerStoryTitle": "Fertilizer Application",
  "fertilizerStorySubtitle": " Fertilizer Application: The Right Time, Right Amount",
  "fertilizerStoryContent": "Applying fertilizers at the correct time and in the right quantity is crucial for healthy crops and maximum yield. Nitrogen-based fertilizers, such as urea, should be applied in split doses rather than all at once. For example, in wheat farming, the first dose should be applied during sowing, while the second dose should be added at the tillering stage to support growth.\nTo prevent nutrient loss, always apply fertilizers early in the morning or late in the evening when temperatures are lower. This reduces evaporation and ensures better absorption.\n Additionally, avoid broadcasting fertilizers on dry soil—instead, apply them when the soil has some moisture to enhance nutrient uptake. By following these best practices, farmers can optimize fertilizer efficiency, reduce costs, and improve soil health over time.",
  "cropRotationStoryTitle": "Crop Rotation",
  "cropRotationStorySubtitle": "Crop Rotation: A Simple Way to Prevent Soil Depletion",
  "cropRotationStoryContent": "Growing the same crop repeatedly in the same field depletes soil nutrients and increases pest problems. Crop rotation—alternating crops in different seasons—helps maintain soil fertility and reduces the risk of diseases.\nFor example, farmers can follow this rotation cycle:\n🌾 Year 1: Grow nitrogen-fixing legumes like pulses or soybeans\n🌽 Year 2: Plant a cereal crop like wheat or maize\n🥔 Year 3: Grow root crops like potatoes or onions\nThis method prevents nutrient exhaustion, disrupts pest life cycles, and improves overall soil health, leading to better yields with lower input costs.",
  "organicPestControlStoryTitle": "Organic Pest Control",
  "organicPestControlStorySubtitle": "Organic Pest Control: Neem Spray for Aphids",
  "organicPestControlStoryContent": "Aphids are common pests that attack vegetables and fruit plants, sucking sap from leaves and causing stunted growth. Instead of using chemical pesticides, which may harm beneficial insects, farmers can use a simple neem oil spray as an organic alternative.\nNeem oil works by disrupting aphid reproduction and feeding behavior. It also repels other harmful insects like whiteflies and mealybugs. Using neem spray regularly helps control infestations while keeping the farm eco-friendly.",
  "smartIrrigationStoryTitle": "Smart Irrigation",
  "smartIrrigationStorySubtitle": "Smart Irrigation: Drip vs. Flooding",
  "smartIrrigationStoryContent": "Water is a precious resource, and efficient irrigation techniques can significantly impact crop health and yield. Many farmers still rely on flood irrigation, where water is spread across the field, leading to wastage and soil erosion.\nAn alternative method, Drip irrigation is especially useful for crops like tomatoes, chilies, and fruit trees, where controlled water delivery improves both quality and yield. Switching to drip irrigation may require an initial investment, but it leads to long-term savings and better crop production.",
